# # Integration measures
# In this section we will cover how to compute different kinds of integrals in DOLFINx.
# To illustrate this, we will use the mesh from {ref}`mesh_generation:eshelby`.
# In this section we explore how different mesh resolutions and mesh order can affect the quality of the solution.
# We will also explore potential drawbacks.

# First, we create a convenience function for generating the mesh from the {ref}`mesh_generation:eshelby`,
# where the only input parameter is the mesh resolution and order.

# We observe that we get an extremely accurate estimate of the area.
# Should we therefore always use higher order meshes?

# #### Potential drawbacks of higher order grids
# In most problems, we are not just computing the surface area or volume of the mesh.
# We usually have an unknown $u_h$ that we need to solve a {term}`PDE` for.
#
# If we choose a **sub-parametric approach**, where we use a **lower order space** for the unknown $u_h$ than
# for the mesh geometry, the solution will be poorly represented.
# There is therefore a balancing act between using a high resolution grid and higher order elements.
#
# It is usual to have higher order convergence rates when using higher order elements, so my rule of thumb is:
# If you use a higher order function-space for your unknown, and you are able to mesh your geometry with a
# higher order element, then do so.
#
# The **exception** to this rule is when you are working with **piecewise straight** geometries, such as squares and boxes,
# as there is no benefit in using higher order elements for these geometries.


# # Integration over facets
# There are other integration measures that can be used in DOLFINx.
# 1. `"dx"` - Integration over all cells in your mesh
# 2. `"ds"` - Integration over all exterior facets in your mesh (All facets connected to only a single cell)
# 3. `"dS"` - Integration over all interior facets in your mesh (All facets connected to two cells)

# We can use the facet markers to integrate over the boundary of the domain

ds_linear = ufl.Measure("ds", domain=linear_mesh, subdomain_data=linear_facettags)

# For the example at hand, we only have one external boundary, which means that it is equivalent to write
# `ds_linear` or `ds_linear(15)`

# ## Example: Boundary integral with spatially varying functions
# In this example we will consider the boundary integral
#
# $$
# \int_{\partial\Omega} g n \cdot v ~\mathrm{d}s\qquad \forall v \in V,
# $$
#
# where `g(x)` is a known function, `n` the outwards pointing facet normal and `v` a test function.

# We create a spatially varying function with {py:class}`ufl.SpatialCoordinate`
# and use {py:class}`ufl.FacetNormal` to symbolically describe the outward pointing normal


def linear_form(element, domain):
    x, y = ufl.SpatialCoordinate(domain)
    g = ufl.sin(x) * ufl.cos(y)
    n = ufl.FacetNormal(domain)
    V = dolfinx.fem.functionspace(domain, element)
    v = ufl.TestFunction(V)
    ds = ufl.Measure("ds", domain=domain)
    return ufl.inner(g * n, v) * ds


# We start by considering a linear element

# +
linear_el = ("Lagrange", 1, (2,))

L1 = linear_form(linear_el, linear_mesh)
# -

# Similarly, we create a form for the curved mesh

L2 = linear_form(linear_el, curved_mesh)

# ## Comparison of the integrals
# We can use UFL to analyze the integrals.
# One of the tools we can use is an estimator of the polynomial degree of the integrand

from ufl.algorithms import expand_derivatives, estimate_total_polynomial_degree

# ## Exercise
# - Do we expect the estimated polynomial degree to be the same for the two integrals?

# + tags=["hide-output"]
print(f"Linear mesh {estimate_total_polynomial_degree(expand_derivatives(L1))}")
print(f"Curved mesh {estimate_total_polynomial_degree(expand_derivatives(L2))}")
# -

# ```{admonition} Explanation
# :class: dropdown
# Since the mapping from the reference to the physical domain is no longer linear,
# we do not have a constant Jacobian. Similarly, the normal vector is no longer constant
# along the facet. This increases the polynomial degree of the integrand.
# ```

# ## Consequences
# Having a higher polynomial estimate means that we require more quadrature points
# to represent the integrand accurately.
# This can lead to a higher computational cost.

# We can use basix to investigate how many quadrature points there are in different default rules.

import basix

points, weights = basix.make_quadrature(linear_mesh.basix_cell(), 7, basix.QuadratureType.default)
print(f"Number of quadrature points: {points.shape[0]}")

points, weights = basix.make_quadrature(linear_mesh.basix_cell(), 15, basix.QuadratureType.default)
print(f"Number of quadrature points: {points.shape[0]}")

# This means that we will do three times the amount of computations on the curved mesh compared to the linear mesh.
# There is also the additional consequence that the Jacobian computation is moved into the
# quadrature loop of the assembly kernels.

# ## How to reduce the computational cost
# One way to reduce the computational cost is to fix the quadrature rule to a given order.
# We can do this through the metadata parameter in the {py:class}`ufl.Measure` object.

dx_restricted = ufl.Measure("dx", domain=curved_mesh, metadata={"quadrature_degree": 7})

# This will override the estimated values by UFL.
# ```{admonition} Variational crimes
# Reducing the accuracy of the integration by lowering the quadrature rule is considered to be a
# **variational crime** {cite}`sulli2012lecture` (Chapter 3.4) and should be done with caution.
